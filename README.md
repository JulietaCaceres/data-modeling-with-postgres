# Data Modeling with Postgres
Project for Data Engineering Nanodegree program at Udacity.


## Objective
This project is an ETL pipeline which takes information from json files, process the data and populate them into a database schema.

The json files are:
**log_data:** Contain information about users and their interactions on the web site "Sparkify". 
The structure of the json is as follow:

Sparkify is a simulated web of music.

**song_data:** Contain information about songs and artist.

This data is processed and stored in the database in a star schema for a particular analytic focus.

## Data base schema

- Fact Table
    - songplays: Records in log data associated with song plays i.e. records with page NextSong
      (songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent)
- Dimension Tables
    - users: users in the app
        (user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level)
    - songs: songs in music database
        (song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration)
    - artists:  artists in music database
        (artist_id, name, location, latitude, longitude)
    - time: timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units
        (start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday)

## Project structure
- /Data : Contains the json files whit the data to be populated
- /databaseUtils: Contains the following python scripts:
    - sql_queries.py: Contains the queries to create a drop tables, and the insert queries to store the data from jsons.
    - create_tables.py: Contains the logic to drop and create the tables used.
- /notebooks: Contian the notebooks with the test:
    - test.ipynb: Contains queries to validate the creation of the tables.
    - etl.ipynb: Contains the first approach to insert data. It iterates over the data frame and insert the data once by time .
    - etl-with-execute-values: Contains the final approach to insert data using the function 'execute_values' in order to reduce the number of round trips to the database server
- /dashboard: Contains the scripts used to generate a dashboard:
    - app.py: Initialize the Dash application.
    - data_fetcher.py: Contain the queries used to extract the data from the database to use it in the dashboard.
    - index.py: Contains the logic to update the graph because of interaction.
    - layouts.py: Contains the components to show in the dashboard.
- etl.py: Contains the transformationes needed to populate the information and insert the data in the database.

## Dashboard

Running the dashboard is possible take some insights from the data.
You can view the top 5 of locations which have more interaction with the application. The n top can change as you prefer.

Also, you can view the traffic on the page over the time, you are able to select the unit of yime (hour, month, year)

Finally you can view the top 5 users who most use the app.

## Run

### Requirements

The following libraries should be installed:
- psycopg2
- pandas
- Dash


### Running

1- Create the tables in sparkify databasse, for that run the script create_table.py:
```console
XXX@XXX:~$ python databaseUtils/create_table.py
```
2- Insert the data:
```console
XXX@XXX:~$ python etl.py
```
To verify the results you can run the test.ipynb


3- Run the dashboard:
```console
XXX@XXX:~$ python dashboard/index.py
```
